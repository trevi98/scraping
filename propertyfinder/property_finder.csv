					Maid			","Do you want to live in a tremendous 3 bedroom mid-terraced townhouse in an amazing gated location? If so, read on to find out why this is an opportunity you mustn't pass up.
 As you cross the threshold of this double-storeyed villa, you'll be able to envisage yourself welcoming every new morning browsing your social feeds, while beholding a view that overlooks an inspiring golden sunset.
Passing through the utilitarian 2,025.77 sq.ft floorplan, you'll discover a great deal of attractive attributes that include a superb L-shaped corner kitchen that is tailor-made for knocking up something yummy, and a master room that is not just for sleeping.
 It also benefits from a tantalizingly cool community swimming pool, a knee-deep children's pool and a sun-drenched swimming pool, which means tanning lotion and cool drinks. 
That's along with a basketball court, a jogging track, a children's playground, a gym, a private gym and a tennis court for your health and fitness related activities. That means you'll keep trim, all year round.
 I would be remiss if I didn't highlight the outdoor space, which includes a sun shaded terrace and a resplendent back garden, that is ideal for lounging after a long day.
With all this on offer, this is exactly the sort of home that you should take a moment to find out about. I strongly recommend viewing the property as soon as possible.
Drop me a line to find out more.
